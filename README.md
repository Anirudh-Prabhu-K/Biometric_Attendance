# Biometric_Attendance
This project is a biometric attendance or authentication system using an ESP32, R307 fingerprint sensor, SSD1306 OLED display, and Google Sheets integration. It detects fingerprints and sends data (name and ID) to a Google Sheet via Wi-Fi, making it suitable for applications like access control or attendance tracking.
